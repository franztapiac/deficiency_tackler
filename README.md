# deficiency_tackler

The deficiency tackler is a tool that suggests what foods one can eat to overcome nutritional deficiencies for their age.

The tool is being built to take in the nutritional deficiency and age of a person. Then, the tool displays foods that one could eat to overcome the given nutritional deficiency.

The tool uses the [FooDB database](https://foodb.ca/), which "is the worldâ€™s largest and most comprehensive resource on food constituents, chemistry and biology" [1]. Data of reference nutritional requirements are used from the study by Mensink et al. [2].
