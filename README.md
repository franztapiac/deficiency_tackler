# deficiency_tackler
Last updated 6 Nov 2023

The purpose of this web app is to identify the food items that contain a given nutrient or compound.
This web app is being developing an exercise for the author to learn about nutrition, as he comes from a biomedical engineering background.

### <u>Current development</u>
The author is currently working on the following:
1. Reading the database information. Most 80% of the database elements are not properly being read by Python pandas.

### <u>Applications of this web app</u>
This web app may have some applications, such as:
1. Support tackling nutritional deficiencies

This was the original purpose of the web app, hence the name "decifiency_tackler".
There is a large deficiency of Vitamin-D in society, as well as of Iron in young women [1]. 
Thus, by submitting what nutrient one is deficient in, the web app would point out which foods one can eat 
to overcome those nutritional deficiencies for the person's age.

### <u>How the web app works</u>
The app uses the [FooDB database](https://foodb.ca/), which "is the worldâ€™s largest and most comprehensive resource on food constituents, chemistry and biology" [2].
Data of reference nutritional requirements are used from the published study by Mensink et al. [1].
